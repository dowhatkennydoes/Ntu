# 11. üß† Intent-Driven AI Automation (10)
- Users can describe a goal (‚ÄúI want to follow up with new leads‚Äù) ‚Üí AI suggests a complete workflow.
- Marathon infers user intent from actions in other apps (e.g., Junction notes ‚Üí suggests Punctual reminder).

- Memory personas (like ‚ÄúResearcher,‚Äù ‚ÄúCoordinator‚Äù) influence automation suggestions.
- User can rate or reject AI suggestions to fine-tune future workflows.
- Workflow builder can suggest optimizations in real-time (e.g., ‚ÄúMerge these 2 Slack messages‚Äù).
- Language model adjusts workflows based on feedback: ‚ÄúMake this simpler.‚Äù
